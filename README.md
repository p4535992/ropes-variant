## How to use:

Ropes & Tethers currently works via macros, there are some included in the macro compendium wich cover the basic applications

First import Start Rope, Add to Rope, End Rope macros

Then Run the start rope macro.
Now select anything (a token, a drawing, a template etc..) and run the Add to Rope macro
When you added the elements you want run the End Rope Macro

## NOTE: If you are a javascript developer and not a typescript developer, you can just use the javascript files under the dist folder

### warpgate

This module uses the [warpgate](https://github.com/trioderegion/warpgate) library. It is a mandatory dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

### socketlib

This module uses the [socketlib](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-socketlib) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

## Features 

# API

###  async game.modules.get('ropse').invokePolymorpherManager(sourceTokenId: string, removePolymorpher = false, ordered = false, random = false, animationExternal:{ sequence:Sequence, timeToWait:number }|undefined = undefined) â‡’ <code>Promise.&lt;void&gt;</code>

Invoke the polymorpher manager feature from macro

**Returns**: <code>Promise.&lt;void&gt;</code> - A empty promise

| Param | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sourceTokenIdOrName | <code>string</code> | The id or the name of the token (not the actor) | <code>undefined</code> |
| removePolymorpher | <code>boolean</code> | This action should revert the polymorpher if the current token is polymorphed | <code>false</code> |
| ordered | <code>boolean</code> | The 'ordered' feature is enabled for this polymorphing | <code>false</code> |
| random | <code>boolean</code> | The 'random' feature is enabled for this polymorphing | <code>0</code> |
| animationExternal | <code>{ sequence:Sequence, timeToWait:number }</code> | Advanced: Use your personal sequence animation and the time needed to wait before the polymorph action, checkout the [Sequencer module](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer) for more information  | <code>undefined</code> |

**Examples**:

`game.modules.get('automated-polymorpher').api.invokePolymorpherManager('Zruggig Widebrain')`

`game.modules.get('automated-polymorpher').api.invokePolymorpherManager('Zruggig Widebrain', true)`

`game.modules.get('automated-polymorpher').api.invokePolymorpherManager('Zruggig Widebrain', false, false)`

`game.modules.get('automated-polymorpher').api.invokePolymorpherManager('Zruggig Widebrain', false, false, false)`

## Integration with socketLib

working in progresso...

# Build

## Install all packages

```bash
npm install
```
## npm build scripts

### build

will build the code and copy all necessary assets into the dist folder and make a symlink to install the result into your foundry data; create a
`foundryconfig.json` file with your Foundry Data path.

```json
{
  "dataPath": "~/.local/share/FoundryVTT/"
}
```

`build` will build and set up a symlink between `dist` and your `dataPath`.

```bash
npm run-script build
```

### NOTE:

You don't need to build the `foundryconfig.json` file you can just copy the content of the `dist` folder on the module folder under `modules` of Foundry

### build:watch

`build:watch` will build and watch for changes, rebuilding automatically.

```bash
npm run-script build:watch
```

### clean

`clean` will remove all contents in the dist folder (but keeps the link from build:install).

```bash
npm run-script clean
```
### lint and lintfix

`lint` launch the eslint process based on the configuration [here](./.eslintrc)

```bash
npm run-script lint
```

`lintfix` launch the eslint process with the fix argument

```bash
npm run-script lintfix
```

### prettier-format

`prettier-format` launch the prettier plugin based on the configuration [here](./.prettierrc)

```bash
npm run-script prettier-format
```

### package

`package` generates a zip file containing the contents of the dist folder generated previously with the `build` command. Useful for those who want to manually load the module or want to create their own release

```bash
npm run-script package
```
